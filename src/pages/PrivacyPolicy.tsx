                <h3>Analytics</h3>

                <p>Google Analytics is integrated on this website.</p>

                <p>
                    Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the
                    gathering, collection and analysis of data about the behavior of
                    visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service
                    collects data on which website a data subject has come to a website from
                    (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or
                    how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A web
                    analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit
                    analysis of Internet advertising.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600
                    Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie
                    about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server
                    in the USA and stored there. Google might transfer the personal
                    information collected via this technical procedure to third parties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As IP anonymization is activated on our website, your IP address will be
                    shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or other
                    states in agreement with the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional
                    cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by a Google server
                    in the USA. On behalf of the operator of the website, Google will use
                    this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on
                    website activity and to provide further services related to website and
                    internet use to us. The IP address transferred through your browser to
                    Google Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, this website uses the Analytics feature UserID to track
                    interaction data. This User ID will be additionally anonymized and
                    encrypted and will not be linked with other data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at
                    any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.

                    If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
                    indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
                    comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

                <p>
                    For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the

                    see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
                    cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
                    edit that information.
                </p>

                    that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include
                    any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security
                    purposes. To make a data change request, please contact the
